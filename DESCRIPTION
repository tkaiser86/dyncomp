Title: Complexity of Short and Coarse-grained Time Series
Version: 0.0.1-5

Description: While there are many well-established measures for identifying critical fluctuations and phase transitions, these measures only work with many points of measurement and thus are unreliable when studying short and coarse-grained time series. This package provides a measure for complexity in a time series that does not rely on long time series.
