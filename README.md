# dyncomp
While there are many well-established measures for identifying critical fluctuations and phase transitions, these measures only work with many points of measurement and thus are unreliable when studying short and coarse-grained time series. This package provides a measure for complexity in a time series that does not rely on long time series.

## Installation
    devtools::install_github("tkaiser86/dyncomp")
    library(dyncomp)
